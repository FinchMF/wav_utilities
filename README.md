# wav_utilities


wav_utilites is a set of modules, classes and functions that explore DSP and musical pitch. This repository is primarily used as a project to practice developing classes and modules. However, it is also a conduit to learn DSP in a more engaged and functional manner. 

Currently the project is centered around making wav files. The files are outputs from input frequencies. The main focus is centered on sonifiying Pi. In the infinite series notebook, you will find the process which developes multiple types of wav formations of Pi as well as sonic output of Pi's harmonic series. Additionally there is the process of layering and concatenating the Pi pitches.
